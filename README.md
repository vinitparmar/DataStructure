## 📊 Sorting Algorithm Complexities

| Algorithm       | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space  |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|--------|
| Bubble Sort     | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)   |
| Selection Sort  | O(n²)     | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)   |
| Insertion Sort  | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)   |
| Merge Sort      | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(n)   |
| Quick Sort      | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n²)      | O(log n) |
| Heap Sort       | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(1)   |
