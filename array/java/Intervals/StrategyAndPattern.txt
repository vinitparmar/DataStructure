Interval problem patterns & strategies

1. Sort by start  --> merging/insert problems.

2. Sort by end --> scheduling / maximize intervals (greedy).

3. Use a result list (or stack) --> when merging overlapping intervals.

4. Use a min-heap (priority queue) --> when you need to track smallest end time (e.g., min meeting rooms).

5. Line sweep / events --> convert intervals to start/end events for counts or max overlap.
